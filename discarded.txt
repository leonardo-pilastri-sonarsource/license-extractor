and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this license.5. disclaimer of warranty.   covered software is provided under this license on an .as is. basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, without limitation, warranties that the covered software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the covered software is with you. should any covered software prove defective in any respect, you (not the initial developer or any other contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair or correction. this disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this license. no use of any covered software is authorized hereunder except under this disclaimer.6. termination.      6.1. this license and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this license shall survive.      6.2. if you assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against initial developer or a contributor (the initial developer or contributor against whom you assert such claim is referred to as .participant.) alleging that the participant software (meaning the contributor version where the participant is a contributor or the original software where the participant is the initial developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to you by such participant, the initial developer (if the initial developer is not the participant) and all contributors under sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this license shall, upon 60 days notice from participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period you withdraw your claim with respect to the participant software against such participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with participant.      6.3. in the event of termination under sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by you or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to you by any distributor) shall survive termination.7. limitation of liability.   under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall you, the initial developer, any other contributor, or any distributor of covered software, or any supplier of any of such parties, be liable to any person for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. this limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party.s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to you.8. u.s. government end users.   the covered software is a .commercial item,. as that term is defined in 48 c.f.r. 2.101 (oct. 1995), consisting of .commercial computer software. (as that term is defined at 48 c.f.r. ? 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and .commercial computer software documentation. as such terms are used in 48 c.f.r. 12.212 (sept. 1995). consistent with 48 c.f.r. 12.212 and 48 c.f.r. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (june 1995), all u.s. government end users acquire covered software with only those rights set forth herein. this u.s. government rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other far, dfar, or other clause or provision that addresses government rights in computer software under this license.9. miscellaneous.   this license represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. if any provision of this license is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. this license shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the original software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction.s conflict-of-law provisions. any litigation relating to this license shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the original software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys. fees and expenses. the application of the united nations convention on contracts for the international sale of goods is expressly excluded. any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this license. you agree that you alone are responsible for compliance with the united states export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when you use, distribute or otherwise make available any covered software.10. responsibility for claims.   as between initial developer and the contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this license and you agree to work with initial developer and contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.   notice pursuant to section 9 of the common development and distribution license (cddl)   the code released under the cddl shall be governed by the laws of the state of california (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). any litigation relating to this license shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the federal courts of the northern district of california and the state courts of the state of california, with venue lying in santa clara county, california.the gnu general public license (gpl) version 2, june 1991copyright (c) 1989, 1991 free software foundation, inc. 59 temple place, suite 330, boston, ma 02111-1307 usaeveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.preamblethe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. by contrast, the gnu general public license is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. this general public license applies to most of the free software foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (some other free software foundation software is covered by the gnu library general public license instead.) you can apply it to your programs, too.when we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. our general public licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.to protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. these restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.for example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. you must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. and you must show them these terms so they know their rights.we protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. if the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. we wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. to prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.the precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification0. this license applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this general public license. the "program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the program" means either the program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) each licensee is addressed as "you".activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope. the act of running the program is not restricted, and the output from the program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the program (independent of having been made by running the program). whether that is true depends on what the program does.1. you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the program a copy of this license along with the program.you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.2. you may modify your copy or copies of the program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:   a) you must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.   b) you must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this license.   c) if the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this license. (exception: if the program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the program is not required to print an announcement.)these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. if identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this license, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. but when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this license, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the program.in addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the program with the program (or with a work based on the program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license.3. you may copy and distribute the program (or a work based on it, under section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:   a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,   b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,   c) accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (this alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with subsection b above.)the source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. for an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. however, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.if distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.4. you may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the program except as expressly provided under this license. any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this license. however, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.5. you are not required to accept this license, since you have not signed it. however, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the program or its derivative works. these actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this license. therefore, by modifying or distributing the program (or any work based on the program), you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the program or works based on it.6. each time you redistribute the program (or any work based on the program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the program subject to these terms and conditions. you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this license.7. if, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this license, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license. if you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the program at all. for example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the program.if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this license.8. if the distribution and/or use of the program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the program under this license may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. in such case, this license incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this license.9. the free software foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the general public license from time to time. such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.each version is given a distinguishing version number. if the program specifies a version number of this license which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the free software foundation. if the program does not specify a version number of this license, you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation.10. if you wish to incorporate parts of the program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. for software which is copyrighted by the free software foundation, write to the free software foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.no warranty11. because the program is licensed free of charge, there is no warranty for the program, to the extent permitted by applicable law. except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and/or other parties provide the program "as is" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you. should the program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.12. in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify and/or redistribute the program as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the program to operate with any other programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.end of terms and conditionshow to apply these terms to your new programsif you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.to do so, attach the following notices to the program. it is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.   one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.   copyright (c)   this program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the gnu general public license as published by the free software foundation; either version 2 of the license, or (at your option) any later version.   this program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but without any warranty; without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. see the gnu general public license for more details.   you should have received a copy of the gnu general public license along with this program; if not, write to the free software foundation, inc., 59 temple place, suite 330, boston, ma 02111-1307 usaalso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.if the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:   gnomovision version 69, copyright (c) year name of author   gnomovision comes with absolutely no warranty; for details type `show w'. this is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.the hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the general public license. of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.you should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. here is a sample; alter the names:   yoyodyne, inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by james hacker.   signature of ty coon, 1 april 1989   ty coon, president of vicethis general public license does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. if your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. if this is what you want to do, use the gnu library general public license instead of this license."classpath" exception to the gpl version 2certain source files distributed by sun microsystems, inc. are subject to the following clarification and special exception to the gpl version 2, but only where sun has expressly included in the particular source file's header the words"sun designates this particular file as subject to the "classpath" exception as provided by sun in the license file that accompanied this code."linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on this library. thus, the terms and conditions of the gnu general public license version 2 cover the whole combination.as a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that module.? an independent module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.? if you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to do so.? if you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.===========================eclipse public license - v 1.0the accompanying program is provided under the terms of this eclipse public license ("agreement"). any use, reproduction or distribution of the program constitutes recipient's acceptance of this agreement.1. definitions"contribution" means:a) in the case of the initial contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this agreement, andb) in the case of each subsequent contributor:i) changes to the program, andii) additions to the program;where such changes and/or additions to the program originate from and are distributed by that particular contributor. a contribution 'originates' from a contributor if it was added to the program by such contributor itself or anyone acting on such contributor's behalf. contributions do not include additions to the program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the program."contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the program."licensed patents" mean patent claims licensable by a contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its contribution alone or when combined with the program."program" means the contributions distributed in accordance with this agreement."recipient" means anyone who receives the program under this agreement, including all contributors.2. grant of rightsa) subject to the terms of this agreement, each contributor hereby grants recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the contribution of such contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.b) subject to the terms of this agreement, each contributor hereby grants recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under licensed patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the contribution of such contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. this patent license shall apply to the combination of the contribution and the program if, at the time the contribution is added by the contributor, such addition of the contribution causes such combination to be covered by the licensed patents. the patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the contribution. no hardware per se is licensed hereunder.c) recipient understands that although each contributor grants the licenses to its contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any contributor that the program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. each contributor disclaims any liability to recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. as a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. for example, if a third party patent license is required to allow recipient to distribute the program, it is recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the program.d) each contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this agreement.3. requirementsa contributor may choose to distribute the program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this agreement; andb) its license agreement:i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this agreement are offered by that contributor alone and not by any other party; andiv) states that source code for the program is available from such contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.when the program is made available in source code form:a) it must be made available under this agreement; andb) a copy of this agreement must be included with each copy of the program.contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the program.each contributor must identify itself as the originator of its contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent recipients to identify the originator of the contribution.4. commercial distributioncommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. while this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the program, the contributor who includes the program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other contributors. therefore, if a contributor includes the program in a commercial product offering, such contributor ("commercial contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other contributor ("indemnified contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the indemnified contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such commercial contributor in connection with its distribution of the program in a commercial product offering. the obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. in order to qualify, an indemnified contributor must: a) promptly notify the commercial contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the commercial contributor to control, and cooperate with the commercial contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. the indemnified contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.for example, a contributor might include the program in a commercial product offering, product x. that contributor is then a commercial contributor. if that commercial contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to product x, those performance claims and warranties are such commercial contributor's responsibility alone. under this section, the commercial contributor would have to defend claims against the other contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other contributor to pay any damages as a result, the commercial contributor must pay those damages.5. no warrantyexcept as expressly set forth in this agreement, the program is provided on an "as is" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. each recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.6. disclaimer of liabilityexcept as expressly set forth in this agreement, neither recipient nor any contributors shall have any liability for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including without limitation lost profits), however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the use or distribution of the program or the exercise of any rights granted hereunder, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.7. generalif any provision of this agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.if recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the program itself (excluding combinations of the program with other software or hardware) infringes such recipient's patent(s), then such recipient's rights granted under section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.all recipient's rights under this agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. if all recipient's rights under this agreement terminate, recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the program as soon as reasonably practicable. however, recipient's obligations under this agreement and any licenses granted by recipient relating to the program shall continue and survive.everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. the agreement steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this agreement from time to time. no one other than the agreement steward has the right to modify this agreement. the eclipse foundation is the initial agreement steward. the eclipse foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the agreement steward to a suitable separate entity. each new version of the agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. the program (including contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the agreement under which it was received. in addition, after a new version of the agreement is published, contributor may elect to distribute the program (including its contributions) under the new version. except as expressly stated in sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any contributor under this agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. all rights in the program not expressly granted under this agreement are reserved.this agreement is governed by the laws of the state of new york and the intellectual property laws of the united states of america. no party to this agreement will bring a legal action under this agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

foundation, inc.     59 temple place, suite 330, boston, ma  02111-1307  usa everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.[this is the first released version of the lesser gpl.  it also counts as the successor of the gnu library public license, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]			    preamble  the licenses for most software are designed to take away yourfreedom to share and change it.  by contrast, the gnu general publiclicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and changefree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  this license, the lesser general public license, applies to somespecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of thefree software foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  youcan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whetherthis license or the ordinary general public license is the betterstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.  when we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,not price.  our general public licenses are designed to make sure thatyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and chargefor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can getit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces ofit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can dothese things.  to protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbiddistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender theserights.  these restrictions translate to certain responsibilities foryou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.  for example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratisor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gaveyou.  you must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the sourcecode.  if you link other code with the library, you must providecomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink themwith the library after making changes to the library and recompilingit.  and you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  we protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright thelibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legalpermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.  to protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear thatthere is no warranty for the free library.  also, if the library ismodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should knowthat what they have is not the original version, so that the originalauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might beintroduced by others.  finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence ofany free program.  we wish to make sure that a company cannoteffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining arestrictive license from a patent holder.  therefore, we insist thatany patent license obtained for a version of the library must beconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.  most gnu software, including some libraries, is covered by theordinary gnu general public license.  this license, the gnu lessergeneral public license, applies to certain designated libraries, andis quite different from the ordinary general public license.  we usethis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking thoselibraries into non-free programs.  when a program is linked with a library, whether statically or usinga shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking acombined work, a derivative of the original library.  the ordinarygeneral public license therefore permits such linking only if theentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  the lesser generalpublic license permits more lax criteria for linking other code withthe library.  we call this license the "lesser" general public license because itdoes less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary generalpublic license.  it also provides other free software developers lessof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  these disadvantagesare the reason we use the ordinary general public license for manylibraries.  however, the lesser license provides advantages in certainspecial circumstances.  for example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need toencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomesa de-facto standard.  to achieve this, non-free programs must beallowed to use the library.  a more frequent case is that a freelibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  in thiscase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to freesoftware only, so we use the lesser general public license.  in other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-freeprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body offree software.  for example, permission to use the gnu c library innon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole gnuoperating system, as well as its variant, the gnu/linux operatingsystem.  although the lesser general public license is less protective of theusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that islinked with the library has the freedom and the wherewithal to runthat program using a modified version of the library.  the precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution andmodification follow.  pay close attention to the difference between a"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  theformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter mustbe combined with the library in order to run.		  gnu lesser general public license   terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification  0. this license agreement applies to any software library or otherprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder orother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms ofthis lesser general public license (also called "this license").each licensee is addressed as "you".  a "library" means a collection of software functions and/or dataprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.  the "library", below, refers to any such software library or workwhich has been distributed under these terms.  a "work based on thelibrary" means either the library or any derivative work undercopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the library or aportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translatedstraightforwardly into another language.  (hereinafter, translation isincluded without limitation in the term "modification".)  "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work formaking modifications to it.  for a library, complete source code meansall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associatedinterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilationand installation of the library.  activities other than copying, distribution and modification are notcovered by this license; they are outside its scope.  the act ofrunning a program using the library is not restricted, and output fromsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work basedon the library (independent of the use of the library in a tool forwriting it).  whether that is true depends on what the library doesand what the program that uses the library does.    1. you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the library'scomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided thatyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy anappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intactall the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of anywarranty; and distribute a copy of this license along with thelibrary.  you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for afee.  2. you may modify your copy or copies of the library or any portionof it, thus forming a work based on the library, and copy anddistribute such modifications or work under the terms of section 1above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:    a) the modified work must itself be a software library.    b) you must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.    c) you must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no    charge to all third parties under the terms of this license.    d) if a facility in the modified library refers to a function or a    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,    in the event an application does not supply such function or    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of    its purpose remains meaningful.    (for example, a function in a library to compute square roots has    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the    application.  therefore, subsection 2d requires that any    application-supplied function or table used by this function must    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square    root function must still compute square roots.)these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  ifidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the library,and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works inthemselves, then this license, and its terms, do not apply to thosesections when you distribute them as separate works.  but when youdistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work basedon the library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms ofthis license, whose permissions for other licensees extend to theentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wroteit.thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contestyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is toexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative orcollective works based on the library.in addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the librarywith the library (or with a work based on the library) on a volume ofa storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work underthe scope of this license.  3. you may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary gnu general publiclicense instead of this license to a given copy of the library.  to dothis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this license, sothat they refer to the ordinary gnu general public license, version 2,instead of to this license.  (if a newer version than version 2 of theordinary gnu general public license has appeared, then you can specifythat version instead if you wish.)  do not make any other change inthese notices.  once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible forthat copy, so the ordinary gnu general public license applies to allsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.  this option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code ofthe library into a program that is not a library.  4. you may copy and distribute the library (or a portion orderivative of it, under section 2) in object code or executable formunder the terms of sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompanyit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, whichmust be distributed under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above on amedium customarily used for software interchange.  if distribution of object code is made by offering access to copyfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy thesource code from the same place satisfies the requirement todistribute the source code, even though third parties are notcompelled to copy the source along with the object code.  5. a program that contains no derivative of any portion of thelibrary, but is designed to work with the library by being compiled orlinked with it, is called a "work that uses the library".  such awork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the library, andtherefore falls outside the scope of this license.  however, linking a "work that uses the library" with the librarycreates an executable that is a derivative of the library (because itcontains portions of the library), rather than a "work that uses thelibrary".  the executable is therefore covered by this license.section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.  when a "work that uses the library" uses material from a header filethat is part of the library, the object code for the work may be aderivative work of the library even though the source code is not.whether this is true is especially significant if the work can belinked without the library, or if the work is itself a library.  thethreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.  if such an object file uses only numerical parameters, datastructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inlinefunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the objectfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivativework.  (executables containing this object code plus portions of thelibrary will still fall under section 6.)  otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the library, you maydistribute the object code for the work under the terms of section 6.any executables containing that work also fall under section 6,whether or not they are linked directly with the library itself.  6. as an exception to the sections above, you may also combine orlink a "work that uses the library" with the library to produce awork containing portions of the library, and distribute that workunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permitmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverseengineering for debugging such modifications.  you must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that thelibrary is used in it and that the library and its use are covered bythis license.  you must supply a copy of this license.  if the workduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include thecopyright notice for the library among them, as well as a referencedirecting the user to the copy of this license.  also, you must do oneof these things:    a) accompany the work with the complete corresponding    machine-readable source code for the library including whatever    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under    sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked    with the library, with the complete machine-readable "work that    uses the library", as object code and/or source code, so that the    user can modify the library and then relink to produce a modified    executable containing the modified library.  (it is understood    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the    library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application    to use the modified definitions.)    b) use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the    library.  a suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.    c) accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at    least three years, to give the same user the materials    specified in subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more    than the cost of performing this distribution.    d) if distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above    specified materials from the same place.    e) verify that the user has already received a copy of these    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.  for an executable, the required form of the "work that uses thelibrary" must include any data and utility programs needed forreproducing the executable from it.  however, as a special exception,the materials to be distributed need not include anything that isnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the majorcomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system onwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompaniesthe executable.  it may happen that this requirement contradicts the licenserestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normallyaccompany the operating system.  such a contradiction means you cannotuse both them and the library together in an executable that youdistribute.  7. you may place library facilities that are a work based on thelibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other libraryfacilities not covered by this license, and distribute such a combinedlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based onthe library and of the other library facilities is otherwisepermitted, and provided that you do these two things:    a) accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work    based on the library, uncombined with any other library    facilities.  this must be distributed under the terms of the    sections above.    b) give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact    that part of it is a work based on the library, and explaining    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.  8. you may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distributethe library except as expressly provided under this license.  anyattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, ordistribute the library is void, and will automatically terminate yourrights under this license.  however, parties who have received copies,or rights, from you under this license will not have their licensesterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.  9. you are not required to accept this license, since you have notsigned it.  however, nothing else grants you permission to modify ordistribute the library or its derivative works.  these actions areprohibited by law if you do not accept this license.  therefore, bymodifying or distributing the library (or any work based on thelibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, andall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifyingthe library or works based on it.  10. each time you redistribute the library (or any work based on thelibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from theoriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the librarysubject to these terms and conditions.  you may not impose any furtherrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties withthis license.  11. if, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patentinfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement orotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this license, they do notexcuse you from the conditions of this license.  if you cannotdistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under thislicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence youmay not distribute the library at all.  for example, if a patentlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the library byall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, thenthe only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be torefrain entirely from distribution of the library.if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under anyparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe anypatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of anysuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting theintegrity of the free software distribution system which isimplemented by public license practices.  many people have madegenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributedthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of thatsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willingto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannotimpose that choice.this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed tobe a consequence of the rest of this license.  12. if the distribution and/or use of the library is restricted incertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, theoriginal copyright holder who places the library under this license may addan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thusexcluded.  in such case, this license incorporates the limitation as ifwritten in the body of this license.  13. the free software foundation may publish revised and/or newversions of the lesser general public license from time to time.such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.each version is given a distinguishing version number.  if the libraryspecifies a version number of this license which applies to it and"any later version", you have the option of following the terms andconditions either of that version or of any later version published bythe free software foundation.  if the library does not specify alicense version number, you may choose any version ever published bythe free software foundation.  14. if you wish to incorporate parts of the library into other freeprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,write to the author to ask for permission.  for software which iscopyrighted by the free software foundation, write to the freesoftware foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  ourdecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free statusof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharingand reuse of software generally.			    no warranty  15. because the library is licensed free of charge, there is nowarranty for the library, to the extent permitted by applicable law.except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and/orother parties provide the library "as is" without warranty of anykind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, theimplied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particularpurpose.  the entire risk as to the quality and performance of thelibrary is with you.  should the library prove defective, you assumethe cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.  16. in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to inwriting will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modifyand/or redistribute the library as permitted above, be liable to youfor damages, including any general, special, incidental orconsequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use thelibrary (including but not limited to loss of data or data beingrendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or afailure of the library to operate with any other software), even ifsuch holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of suchdamages.		     end of terms and conditions		                how to apply these terms to your new libraries  if you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatestpossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software thateveryone can redistribute and change.  you can do so by permittingredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of theordinary general public license).  to apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  it issafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectivelyconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>    copyright (c) <year>  <name of author>    this library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or    modify it under the terms of the gnu lesser general public    license as published by the free software foundation; either    version 2.1 of the license, or (at your option) any later version.    this library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,    but without any warranty; without even the implied warranty of    merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.  see the gnu    lesser general public license for more details.    you should have received a copy of the gnu lesser general public    license along with this library; if not, write to the free software    foundation, inc., 59 temple place, suite 330, boston, ma  02111-1307  usaalso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.you should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or yourschool, if any, to sign a

"contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the program.    "licensed patents " mean patent claims licensable by a contributor which    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its contribution alone    or when combined with the program.    "program" means the contributions distributed in accordance with this    agreement.    "recipient" means anyone who receives the program under this agreement,    including all contributors.    2. grant of rights    a) subject to the terms of this agreement, each contributor hereby grants       recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license       to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly       perform, distribute and sublicense the contribution of such       contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and       object code form.    b) subject to the terms of this agreement, each contributor hereby grants       recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under       licensed patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and       otherwise transfer the contribution of such contributor, if any, in       source code and object code form. this patent license shall apply to       the combination of the contribution and the program if, at the time       the contribution is added by the contributor, such addition of the       contribution causes such combination to be covered by the licensed       patents. the patent license shall not apply to any other combinations       which include the contribution. no hardware per se is licensed       hereunder.    c) recipient understands that although each contributor grants the       licenses to its contributions set forth herein, no assurances are       provided by any contributor that the program does not infringe the       patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.       each contributor disclaims any liability to recipient for claims       brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual       property rights or otherwise. as a condition to exercising the rights       and licenses granted hereunder, each recipient hereby assumes sole       responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights       needed, if any. for example, if a third party patent license is       required to allow recipient to distribute the program, it is       recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before       distributing the program.    d) each contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient       copyright rights in its contribution, if any, to grant the copyright       license set forth in this agreement.    3. requirements    a contributor may choose to distribute the program in object code form    under its own license agreement, provided that:    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this agreement; and    b) its license agreement:       i)   effectively disclaims on behalf of all contributors all warranties            and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or            conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties            or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular            purpose;       ii)  effectively excludes on behalf of all contributors all liability            for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and            consequential damages, such as lost profits;       iii) states that any provisions which differ from this agreement are            offered by that contributor alone and not by any other party; and       iv)  states that source code for the program is available from such            contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a            reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for            software exchange.    when the program is made available in source code form:    a) it must be made available under this agreement; and    b) a copy of this agreement must be included with each copy of       the program.    contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained    within the program.    each contributor must identify itself as the originator of its    contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent    recipients to identify the originator of the contribution.    4. commercial distribution    commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. while this    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the program,    the contributor who includes the program in a commercial product offering    should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for    other contributors. therefore, if a contributor includes the program    in a commercial product offering, such contributor ("commercial    contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other    contributor ("indemnified contributor") against any losses, damages    and costs (collectively "losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and    other legal actions brought by a third party against the indemnified    contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such    commercial contributor in connection with its distribution of the    program in a commercial product offering. the obligations in this    section do not apply to any claims or losses relating to any actual    or alleged intellectual property infringement. in order to qualify,    an indemnified contributor must: a) promptly notify the commercial    contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the commercial    contributor to control, and cooperate with the commercial contributor    in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. the indemnified    contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.    for example, a contributor might include the program in a commercial    product offering, product x. that contributor is then a commercial    contributor. if that commercial contributor then makes performance    claims, or offers warranties related to product x, those performance    claims and warranties are such commercial contributor's responsibility    alone. under this section, the commercial contributor would have to    defend claims against the other contributors related to those    performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other    contributor to pay any damages as a result, the commercial contributor    must pay those damages.    5. no warranty    except as expressly set forth in this agreement, the program is provided    on an "as is" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either    express or implied including, without limitation, any warranties or    conditions of title, non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for    a particular purpose. each recipient is solely responsible for    determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the program    and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this    agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program    errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,    programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.    6. disclaimer of liability    except as expressly set forth in this agreement, neither recipient nor    any contributors shall have any liability for any direct, indirect,    incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including    without limitation lost profits), however caused and on any theory of    liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort (including    negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the use or    distribution of the program or the exercise of any rights granted    hereunder, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.    7. general    if any provision of this agreement is invalid or unenforceable under    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of    the remainder of the terms of this agreement, and without further    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.    if recipient institutes patent litigation against a contributor with    respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or    counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that    contributor to such recipient under this agreement shall terminate as of    the date such litigation is filed. in addition, if recipient institutes    patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or    counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the program itself (excluding    combinations of the program with other software or hardware) infringes    such recipient's patent(s), then such recipient's rights granted under    section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.    all recipient's rights under this agreement shall terminate if it fails    to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this agreement    and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after    becoming aware of such noncompliance. if all recipient's rights under    this agreement terminate, recipient agrees to cease use and distribution    of the program as soon as reasonably practicable. however, recipient's    obligations under this agreement and any licenses granted by recipient    relating to the program shall continue and survive.    everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this agreement,    but in order to avoid inconsistency the agreement is copyrighted and may    only be modified in the following manner. the agreement steward reserves    the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this agreement    from time to time. no one other than the agreement steward has the right    to modify this agreement. ibm is the initial agreement steward. ibm may    assign the responsibility to serve as the agreement steward to a suitable    separate entity. each new version of the agreement will be given a    distinguishing version number. the program (including contributions) may    always be distributed subject to the version of the agreement under which    it was received. in addition, after a new version of the agreement is    published, contributor may elect to distribute the program (including    its contributions) under the new version. except as expressly stated in    sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, recipient receives no rights or licenses    to the intellectual property of any contributor under this agreement,    whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. all rights in    the program not expressly granted under this agreement are reserved.    this agreement is governed by the laws of the state of new york and the    intellectual property laws of the united states of america. no party to    this agreement will bring a legal action under this agreement more than    one year after the cause of action arose. each party waives its rights    to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

(b) contributor apis.              if contributor's modifications include an application programming              interface and contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which              are reasonably necessary to implement that api, contributor must              also include this information in the legal file.                   (c)    representations.              contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to              section 3.4(a) above, contributor believes that contributor's              modifications are contributor's original creation(s) and/or              contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by              this license.         3.5. required notices.         you must duplicate the notice in exhibit a in each file of the source         code.  if it is not possible to put such notice in a particular source         code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a         location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely         to look for such a notice.  if you created one or more modification(s)         you may add your name as a contributor to the notice described in         exhibit a.  you must also duplicate this license in any documentation         for the source code where you describe recipients' rights or ownership         rights relating to covered code.  you may choose to offer, and to         charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability         obligations to one or more recipients of covered code. however, you         may do so only on your own behalf, and not on behalf of the initial         developer or any contributor. you must make it absolutely clear than         any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is         offered by you alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify the initial         developer and every contributor for any liability incurred by the         initial developer or such contributor as a result of warranty,         support, indemnity or liability terms you offer.         3.6. distribution of executable versions.         you may distribute covered code in executable form only if the         requirements of section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that covered code,         and if you include a notice stating that the source code version of         the covered code is available under the terms of this license,         including a description of how and where you have fulfilled the         obligations of section 3.2. the notice must be conspicuously included         in any notice in an executable version, related documentation or         collateral in which you describe recipients' rights relating to the         covered code. you may distribute the executable version of covered         code or ownership rights under a license of your choice, which may         contain terms different from this license, provided that you are in         compliance with the terms of this license and that the license for the         executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's         rights in the source code version from the rights set forth in this         license. if you distribute the executable version under a different         license you must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ         from this license are offered by you alone, not by the initial         developer or any contributor. you hereby agree to indemnify the         initial developer and every contributor for any liability incurred by         the initial developer or such contributor as a result of any such         terms you offer.         3.7. larger works.         you may create a larger work by combining covered code with other code         not governed by the terms of this license and distribute the larger         work as a single product. in such a case, you must make sure the         requirements of this license are fulfilled for the covered code.    4. inability to comply due to statute or regulation.         if it is impossible for you to comply with any of the terms of this         license with respect to some or all of the covered code due to         statute, judicial order, or regulation then you must: (a) comply with         the terms of this license to the maximum extent possible; and (b)         describe the limitations and the code they affect. such description         must be included in the legal file described in section 3.4 and must         be included with all distributions of the source code. except to the         extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be         sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to         understand it.    5. application of this license.         this license applies to code to which the initial developer has         attached the notice in exhibit a and to related covered code.    6. versions of the license.         6.1. new versions.         netscape communications corporation ("netscape") may publish revised         and/or new versions of the license from time to time. each version         will be given a distinguishing version number.         6.2. effect of new versions.         once covered code has been published under a particular version of the         license, you may always continue to use it under the terms of that         version. you may also choose to use such covered code under the terms         of any subsequent version of the license published by netscape. no one         other than netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to         covered code created under this license.         6.3. derivative works.         if you create or use a modified version of this license (which you may         only do in order to apply it to code which is not already covered code         governed by this license), you must (a) rename your license so that         the phrases "mozilla", "mozillapl", "mozpl", "netscape",         "mpl", "npl" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your         license (except to note that your license differs from this license)         and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license         contains terms which differ from the mozilla public license and         netscape public license. (filling in the name of the initial         developer, original code or contributor in the notice described in         exhibit a shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of         this license.)    7. disclaimer of warranty.         covered code is provided under this license on an "as is" basis,         without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including,         without limitation, warranties that the covered code is free of         defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.         the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the covered code         is with you. should any covered code prove defective in any respect,         you (not the initial developer or any other contributor) assume the         cost of any necessary servicing, repair or correction. this disclaimer         of warranty constitutes an essential part of this license. no use of         any covered code is authorized hereunder except under this disclaimer.    8. termination.         8.1.  this license and the rights granted hereunder will terminate         automatically if you fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure         such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. all         sublicenses to the covered code which are properly granted shall         survive any termination of this license. provisions which, by their         nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this license         shall survive.         8.2.  if you initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement         claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against initial developer         or a contributor (the initial developer or contributor against whom         you file such action is referred to as "participant")  alleging that:         (a)  such participant's contributor version directly or indirectly         infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such         participant to you under sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this license         shall, upon 60 days notice from participant terminate prospectively,         unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice you either: (i)         agree in writing to pay participant a mutually agreeable reasonable         royalty for your past and future use of modifications made by such         participant, or (ii) withdraw your litigation claim with respect to         the contributor version against such participant.  if within 60 days         of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not         mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim         is not withdrawn, the rights granted by participant to you under         sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of         the 60 day notice period specified above.         (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such participant's         contributor version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then         any rights granted to you by such participant under sections 2.1(b)         and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date you first made, used,         sold, distributed, or had made, modifications made by that         participant.         8.3.  if you assert a patent infringement claim against participant         alleging that such participant's contributor version directly or         indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as         by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent         infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses         granted by such participant under sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken         into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or         license.         8.4.  in the event of termination under sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,         all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)         which have been validly granted by you or any distributor hereunder         prior to termination shall survive termination.    9. limitation of liability.         under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort         (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall you, the initial         developer, any other contributor, or any distributor of covered code,         or any supplier of any of such parties, be liable to any person for         any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any         character including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill,         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other         commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been         informed of the possibility of such damages. this limitation of         liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury         resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law         prohibits such limitation. some jurisdictions do not allow the         exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so         this exclusion and limitation may not apply to you.    10. u.s. government end users.         the covered code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in         48 c.f.r. 2.101 (oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer         software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such         terms are used in 48 c.f.r. 12.212 (sept. 1995). consistent with 48         c.f.r. 12.212 and 48 c.f.r. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (june 1995),         all u.s. government end users acquire covered code with only those         rights set forth herein.    11. miscellaneous.         this license represents the complete agreement concerning subject         matter hereof. if any provision of this license is held to be         unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent         necessary to make it enforceable. this license shall be governed by         california law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if         any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.         with respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,         or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the united         states of america, any litigation relating to this license shall be         subject to the jurisdiction of the federal courts of the northern         district of california, with venue lying in santa clara county,         california, with the losing party responsible for costs, including         without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and         expenses. the application of the united nations convention on         contracts for the international sale of goods is expressly excluded.         any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract         shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this         license.    12. responsibility for claims.         as between initial developer and the contributors, each party is         responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,         out of its utilization of rights under this license and you agree to         work with initial developer and contributors to distribute such         responsibility on an equitable basis. nothing herein is intended or         shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.    13. multiple-licensed code.         initial developer may designate portions of the covered code as         "multiple-licensed".

DISCARDED:                      server side public license                     version 1, october 16, 2018                    copyright © 2018 mongodb, inc.  everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this  license document, but changing it is not allowed.                       terms and conditions  0. definitions.  “this license” refers to server side public license.  “copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of  works, such as semiconductor masks.  “the program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this  license.  each licensee is addressed as “you”. “licensees” and  “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.  to “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in  a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an  exact copy. the resulting work is called a “modified version” of the  earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.  a “covered work” means either the unmodified program or a work based on  the program.  to “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without  permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for  infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a  computer or modifying a private copy. propagation includes copying,  distribution (with or without modification), making available to the  public, and in some countries other activities as well.  to “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other  parties to make or receive copies. mere interaction with a user through a  computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.  an interactive user interface displays “appropriate legal notices” to the  extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that  (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that  there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties  are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this license, and  how to view a copy of this license. if the interface presents a list of  user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list  meets this criterion.  1. source code.  the “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for  making modifications to it. “object code” means any non-source form of a  work.  a “standard interface” means an interface that either is an official  standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of  interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is  widely used among developers working in that language.  the “system  libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as  a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a major  component, but which is not part of that major component, and (b) serves  only to enable use of the work with that major component, or to implement  a standard interface for which an implementation is available to the  public in source code form. a “major component”, in this context, means a  major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the  specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or  a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used  to run it.  the “corresponding source” for a work in object code form means all the  source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run  the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control  those activities. however, it does not include the work's system  libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs  which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are  not part of the work. for example, corresponding source includes  interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and  the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms  that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate  data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other  parts of the work.  the corresponding source need not include anything that users can  regenerate automatically from other parts of the corresponding source.  the corresponding source for a work in source code form is that same work.  2. basic permissions.  all rights granted under this license are granted for the term of  copyright on the program, and are irrevocable provided the stated  conditions are met. this license explicitly affirms your unlimited  permission to run the unmodified program, subject to section 13. the  output from running a covered work is covered by this license only if the  output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. this license  acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by  copyright law.  subject to section 13, you may make, run and propagate  covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your  license otherwise remains in force. you may convey covered works to  others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively  for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided  that you comply with the terms of this license in conveying all  material for which you do not control copyright. those thus making or  running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your  behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them  from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their  relationship with you.  conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the  conditions stated below. sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it  unnecessary.  3. protecting users' legal rights from anti-circumvention law.  no covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological  measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11  of the wipo copyright treaty adopted on 20 december 1996, or similar laws  prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.  when you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid  circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is  effected by exercising rights under this license with respect to the  covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or  modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users,  your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of  technological measures.  4. conveying verbatim copies.  you may convey verbatim copies of the program's source code as you  receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and  appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep  intact all notices stating that this license and any non-permissive terms  added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices  of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this  license along with the program.  you may charge any price or no price for  each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty  protection for a fee.  5. conveying modified source versions.  you may convey a work based on the program, or the modifications to  produce it from the program, in the form of source code under the terms  of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:    a) the work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,    and giving a relevant date.    b) the work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released    under this license and any conditions added under section 7. this    requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all    notices”.    c) you must license the entire work, as a whole, under this license to    anyone who comes into possession of a copy. this license will therefore    apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the    whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are    packaged. this license gives no permission to license the work in any    other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have    separately received it.    d) if the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display    appropriate legal notices; however, if the program has interactive    interfaces that do not display appropriate legal notices, your work    need not make them do so.  a compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent  works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and  which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on  a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if  the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the  access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the  individual works permit. inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does  not cause this license to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.  6. conveying non-source forms.  you may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of  sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable  corresponding source under the terms of this license, in one of these  ways:    a) convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the    corresponding source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily    used for software interchange.    b) convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written    offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you    offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give    anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the    corresponding source for all the software in the product that is    covered by this license, on a durable physical medium customarily used    for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost    of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to    copy the corresponding source from a network server at no charge.    c) convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the    written offer to provide the corresponding source. this alternative is    allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received    the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.    d) convey the object code by offering access from a designated place    (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the    corresponding source in the same way through the same place at no    further charge. you need not require recipients to copy the    corresponding source along with the object code. if the place to copy    the object code is a network server, the corresponding source may be on    a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports    equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions    next to the object code saying where to find the corresponding source.    regardless of what server hosts the corresponding source, you remain    obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to    satisfy these requirements.    e) convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you    inform other peers where the object code and corresponding source of    the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under    subsection 6d.  a separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded  from the corresponding source as a system library, need not be included  in conveying the object code work.  a “user product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any  tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,  or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation  into a dwelling. in determining whether a product is a consumer product,  doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. for a particular  product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a  typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status  of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user  actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. a product  is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial  commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent  the only significant mode of use of the product.  “installation information” for a user product means any methods,  procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install  and execute modified versions of a covered work in that user product from  a modified version of its corresponding source. the information must  suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object  code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because  modification has been made.  if you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or  specifically for use in, a user product, and the conveying occurs as part  of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the user  product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term  (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the corresponding  source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the  installation information. but this requirement does not apply if neither  you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object  code on the user product (for example, the work has been installed in  rom).  the requirement to provide installation information does not include a  requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates  for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for  the user product in which it has been modified or installed. access  to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially  and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the  rules and protocols for communication across the network.  corresponding source conveyed, and installation information provided, in  accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented  (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form),  and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or  copying.  7. additional terms.  “additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this  license by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.  additional permissions that are applicable to the entire program shall be  treated as though they were included in this license, to the extent that  they are valid under applicable law. if additional permissions apply only  to part of the program, that part may be used separately under those  permissions, but the entire program remains governed by this license  without regard to the additional permissions.  when you convey a copy of  a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions  from that copy, or from any part of it. (additional permissions may be  written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the  work.) you may place additional permissions on material, added by you to  a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright  permission.  notwithstanding any other provision of this license, for material you add  to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of  that material) supplement the terms of this license with terms:    a) disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this license; or    b) requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or    author attributions in that material or in the appropriate legal    notices displayed by works containing it; or    c) prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or    d) limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or    authors of the material; or    e) declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade    names, trademarks, or service marks; or    f) requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material    by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with    contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any    liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those    licensors and authors.  all other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further  restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. if the program as you  received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is  governed by this license along with a term that is a further restriction,  you may remove that term. if a license document contains a further  restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this license, you  may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license  document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such  relicensing or conveying.  if you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must  place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms  that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the  applicable terms.  additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be  stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as  exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.  8. termination.  you may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly  provided under this license. any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify  it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this  license (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph  of section 11).  however, if you cease all violation of this license, then your license  from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,  unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates  your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to  notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days  after the cessation.  moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated  permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some  reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of  violation of this license (for any work) from that copyright holder, and  you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.  termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the  licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under  this license. if your rights have been terminated and not permanently  reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same  material under section 10.  9. acceptance not required for having copies.  you are not required to accept this license in order to receive or run a  copy of the program. ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring  solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a  copy likewise does not require acceptance. however, nothing other than  this license grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered  work. these actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this license.  therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your  acceptance of this license to do so.  10. automatic licensing of downstream recipients.  each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives  a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that  work, subject to this license. you are not responsible for enforcing  compliance by third parties with this license.  an “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an  organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an  organization, or merging organizations. if propagation of a covered work  results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who  receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work  the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous  paragraph, plus a right to possession of the corresponding source of the  work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can  get it with reasonable efforts.  you may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights  granted or affirmed under this license. for example, you may not impose a  license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted  under this license, and you may not initiate litigation (including a  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim  is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing  the program or any portion of it.  11. patents.  a “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this  license of the program or a work on which the program is based. the work  thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.  a contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or  controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter  acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this  license, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not  include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further  modification of the contributor version. for purposes of this definition,  “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner  consistent with the requirements of this license.  each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free  patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make,  use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate  the contents of its contributor version.  in the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express  agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent  (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to  sue for patent infringement). to “grant” such a patent license to a party  means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent  against the party.  if you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and  the corresponding source of the work is not available for anyone to copy,  free of charge and under the terms of this license, through a publicly  available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must  either (1) cause the corresponding source to be so available, or (2)  arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this  particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the  requirements of this license, to extend the patent license to downstream  recipients. “knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but  for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or  your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe  one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason  to believe are valid.  if, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or  arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a  covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving  the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a  specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is  automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works  based on it.  a patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the  scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on  the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically  granted under this license. you may not convey a covered work if you are  a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of  distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party  based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under  which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the  covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection  with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from  those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific  products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you  entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior  to 28 march 2007.  nothing in this license shall be construed as excluding or limiting any  implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be  available to you under applicable patent law.  12. no surrender of others' freedom.  if conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this license, they do not  excuse you from the conditions of this license. if you cannot use,  propagate or convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your  obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations, then  as a consequence you may not use, propagate or convey it at all. for  example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for  further conveying from those to whom you convey the program, the only way  you could satisfy both those terms and this license would be to refrain  entirely from conveying the program.  13. offering the program as a service.  if you make the functionality of the program or a modified version  available to third parties as a service, you must make the service source  code available via network download to everyone at no charge, under the  terms of this license. making the functionality of the program or  modified version available to third parties as a service includes,  without limitation, enabling third parties to interact with the  functionality of the program or modified version remotely through a  computer network, offering a service the value of which entirely or  primarily derives from the value of the program or modified version, or  offering a service that accomplishes for users the primary purpose of the  program or modified version.  “service source code” means the corresponding source for the program or  the modified version, and the corresponding source for all programs that  you use to make the program or modified version available as a service,  including, without limitation, management software, user interfaces,  application program interfaces, automation software, monitoring software,  backup software, storage software and hosting software, all such that a  user could run an instance of the service using the service source code  you make available.  14. revised versions of this license.  mongodb, inc. may publish revised and/or new versions of the server side  public license from time to time. such new versions will be similar in  spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new  problems or concerns.  each version is given a distinguishing version number. if the program  specifies that a certain numbered version of the server side public  license “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of  following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of  any later version published by mongodb, inc. if the program does not  specify a version number of the server side public license, you may  choose any version ever published by mongodb, inc.  if the program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of  the server side public license can be used, that proxy's public statement  of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that  version for the program.  later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.  however, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright  holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.  15. disclaimer of warranty.  there is no warranty for the program, to the extent permitted by  applicable law. except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright  holders and/or other parties provide the program “as is” without warranty  of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to,  the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular  purpose. the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program  is with you. should the program prove defective, you assume the cost of  all necessary servicing, repair or correction.  16. limitation of liability.  in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing  will any copyright holder, or any other party who modifies and/or conveys  the program as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including  any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of  the use or inability to use the program (including but not limited to  loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you  or third parties or a failure of the program to operate with any other  programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the  possibility of such damages.  17. interpretation of sections 15 and 16.  if the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above  cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing  courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute  waiver of all civil liability in connection with the program, unless a  warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the program in  return for a fee.                        end of terms and conditionselastic license 2.0url: https://www.elastic.co/licensing/elastic-license## acceptanceby using the software, you agree to all of the terms and

DISCARDED:                    gnu lesser general public license                       version 3, 29 june 2007 copyright (c) 2007 free software foundation, inc. <http://fsf.org/> everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  this version of the gnu lesser general public license incorporatesthe terms and conditions of version 3 of the gnu general publiclicense, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.  0. additional definitions.  as used herein, "this license" refers to version 3 of the gnu lessergeneral public license, and the "gnu gpl" refers to version 3 of the gnugeneral public license.  "the library" refers to a covered work governed by this license,other than an application or a combined work as defined below.  an "application" is any work that makes use of an interface providedby the library, but which is not otherwise based on the library.defining a subclass of a class defined by the library is deemed a modeof using an interface provided by the library.  a "combined work" is a work produced by combining or linking anapplication with the library.  the particular version of the librarywith which the combined work was made is also called the "linkedversion".  the "minimal corresponding source" for a combined work means thecorresponding source for the combined work, excluding any source codefor portions of the combined work that, considered in isolation, arebased on the application, and not on the linked version.  the "corresponding application code" for a combined work means theobject code and/or source code for the application, including any dataand utility programs needed for reproducing the combined work from theapplication, but excluding the system libraries of the combined work.  1. exception to section 3 of the gnu gpl.  you may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this licensewithout being bound by section 3 of the gnu gpl.  2. conveying modified versions.  if you modify a copy of the library, and, in your modifications, afacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an applicationthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when thefacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modifiedversion:   a) under this license, provided that you make a good faith effort to   ensure that, in the event an application does not supply the   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or   b) under the gnu gpl, with none of the additional permissions of   this license applicable to that copy.  3. object code incorporating material from library header files.  the object code form of an application may incorporate material froma header file that is part of the library.  you may convey such objectcode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporatedmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structurelayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:   a) give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the   library is used in it and that the library and its use are   covered by this license.   b) accompany the object code with a copy of the gnu gpl and this license   document.  4. combined works.  you may convey a combined work under terms of your choice that,taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of theportions of the library contained in the combined work and reverseengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each ofthe following:   a) give prominent notice with each copy of the combined work that   the library is used in it and that the library and its use are   covered by this license.   b) accompany the combined work with a copy of the gnu gpl and this license   document.   c) for a combined work that displays copyright notices during   execution, include the copyright notice for the library among   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the   copies of the gnu gpl and this license document.   d) do one of the following:       0) convey the minimal corresponding source under the terms of this       license, and the corresponding application code in a form       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to       recombine or relink the application with a modified version of       the linked version to produce a modified combined work, in the       manner specified by section 6 of the gnu gpl for conveying       corresponding source.       1) use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the       library.  a suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time       a copy of the library already present on the user's computer       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version       of the library that is interface-compatible with the linked       version.   e) provide installation information, but only if you would otherwise   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the   gnu gpl, and only to the extent that such information is   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the   combined work produced by recombining or relinking the   application with a modified version of the linked version. (if   you use option 4d0, the installation information must accompany   the minimal corresponding source and corresponding application   code. if you use option 4d1, you must provide the installation   information in the manner specified by section 6 of the gnu gpl   for conveying corresponding source.)  5. combined libraries.  you may place library facilities that are a work based on thelibrary side by side in a single library together with other libraryfacilities that are not applications and are not covered by thislicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of yourchoice, if you do both of the following:   a) accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based   on the library, uncombined with any other library facilities,   conveyed under the terms of this license.   b) give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it   is a work based on the library, and explaining where to find the   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.  6. revised versions of the gnu lesser general public license.  the free software foundation may publish revised and/or new versionsof the gnu lesser general public license from time to time. such newversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but maydiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.  each version is given a distinguishing version number. if thelibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered versionof the gnu lesser general public license "or any later version"applies to it, you have the option of following the terms andconditions either of that published version or of any later versionpublished by the free software foundation. if the library as youreceived it does not specify a version number of the gnu lessergeneral public license, you may choose any version of the gnu lessergeneral public license ever published by the free software foundation.  if the library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decidewhether future versions of the gnu lesser general public license shallapply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version ispermanent authorization for you to choose that version for thelibrary.

DISCARDED: # eclipse public license - v 2.0        the accompanying program is provided under the terms of this eclipse        public license ("agreement"). any use, reproduction or distribution        of the program constitutes recipient's acceptance of this agreement.    1. definitions    "contribution" means:      a) in the case of the initial contributor, the initial content         distributed under this agreement, and      b) in the case of each subsequent contributor:          i) changes to the program, and          ii) additions to the program;      where such changes and/or additions to the program originate from      and are distributed by that particular contributor. a contribution      "originates" from a contributor if it was added to the program by      such contributor itself or anyone acting on such contributor's behalf.      contributions do not include changes or additions to the program that      are not modified works.    "contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the program.    "licensed patents" mean patent claims licensable by a contributor which    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its contribution alone    or when combined with the program.    "program" means the contributions distributed in accordance with this    agreement.    "recipient" means anyone who receives the program under this agreement    or any secondary license (as applicable), including contributors.    "derivative works" shall mean any work, whether in source code or other    form, that is based on (or derived from) the program and for which the    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.    "modified works" shall mean any work in source code or other form that    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the    contents of the program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file    in source code form that contains any contents of the program. modified    works shall not include works that contain only declarations,    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the program solely    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the program    or modified works thereof.    "distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.    "source code" means the form of a program preferred for making    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,    documentation source, and configuration files.    "secondary license" means either the gnu general public license,    version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial    contributor.    2. grant of rights      a) subject to the terms of this agreement, each contributor hereby      grants recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright      license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,      publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the contribution of such      contributor, if any, and such derivative works.      b) subject to the terms of this agreement, each contributor hereby      grants recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent      license under licensed patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,      import and otherwise transfer the contribution of such contributor,      if any, in source code or other form. this patent license shall      apply to the combination of the contribution and the program if, at      the time the contribution is added by the contributor, such addition      of the contribution causes such combination to be covered by the      licensed patents. the patent license shall not apply to any other      combinations which include the contribution. no hardware per se is      licensed hereunder.      c) recipient understands that although each contributor grants the      licenses to its contributions set forth herein, no assurances are      provided by any contributor that the program does not infringe the      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.      each contributor disclaims any liability to recipient for claims      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual      property rights or otherwise. as a condition to exercising the      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each recipient hereby      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual      property rights needed, if any. for example, if a third party      patent license is required to allow recipient to distribute the      program, it is recipient's responsibility to acquire that license      before distributing the program.      d) each contributor represents that to its knowledge it has      sufficient copyright rights in its contribution, if any, to grant      the copyright license set forth in this agreement.      e) notwithstanding the terms of any secondary license, no      contributor makes additional grants to any recipient (other than      those set forth in this agreement) as a result of such recipient's      receipt of the program under the terms of a secondary license      (if permitted under the terms of section 3).    3. requirements    3.1 if a contributor distributes the program in any form, then:      a) the program must also be made available as source code, in      accordance with section 3.2, and the contributor must accompany      the program with a statement that the source code for the program      is available under this agreement, and informs recipients how to      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily      used for software exchange; and      b) the contributor may distribute the program under a license      different than this agreement, provided that such license:         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other contributors all         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness         for a particular purpose;         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other contributors all         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights         in the source code under section 3.2; and         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the program by any         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements         of this section 3.    3.2 when the program is distributed as source code:      a) it must be made available under this agreement, or if the      program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or      files made available under a secondary license, and (ii) the initial      contributor attached to the source code the notice described in      exhibit a of this agreement, then the program may be made available      under the terms of such secondary licenses, and      b) a copy of this agreement must be included with each copy of      the program.    3.3 contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations    of liability ("notices") contained within the program from any copy of    the program which they distribute, provided that contributors may add    their own appropriate notices.    4. commercial distribution    commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. while this    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the program,    the contributor who includes the program in a commercial product    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential    liability for other contributors. therefore, if a contributor includes    the program in a commercial product offering, such contributor    ("commercial contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every    other contributor ("indemnified contributor") against any losses,    damages and costs (collectively "losses") arising from claims, lawsuits    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the indemnified    contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such    commercial contributor in connection with its distribution of the program    in a commercial product offering. the obligations in this section do not    apply to any claims or losses relating to any actual or alleged    intellectual property infringement. in order to qualify, an indemnified    contributor must: a) promptly notify the commercial contributor in    writing of such claim, and b) allow the commercial contributor to control,    and cooperate with the commercial contributor in, the defense and any    related settlement negotiations. the indemnified contributor may    participate in any such claim at its own expense.    for example, a contributor might include the program in a commercial    product offering, product x. that contributor is then a commercial    contributor. if that commercial contributor then makes performance    claims, or offers warranties related to product x, those performance    claims and warranties are such commercial contributor's responsibility    alone. under this section, the commercial contributor would have to    defend claims against the other contributors related to those performance    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other contributor to    pay any damages as a result, the commercial contributor must pay    those damages.    5. no warranty    except as expressly set forth in this agreement, and to the extent    permitted by applicable law, the program is provided on an "as is"    basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or    implied including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of    title, non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular    purpose. each recipient is solely responsible for determining the    appropriateness of using and distributing the program and assumes all    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this agreement,    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.    6. disclaimer of liability    except as expressly set forth in this agreement, and to the extent    permitted by applicable law, neither recipient nor any contributors    shall have any liability for any direct, indirect, incidental, special,    exemplary, or consequential damages (including without limitation lost    profits), however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in    contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise)    arising in any way out of the use or distribution of the program or the    exercise of any rights granted hereunder, even if advised of the    possibility of such damages.    7. general    if any provision of this agreement is invalid or unenforceable under    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of    the remainder of the terms of this agreement, and without further    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.    if recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the    program itself (excluding combinations of the program with other software    or hardware) infringes such recipient's patent(s), then such recipient's    rights granted under section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such    litigation is filed.    all recipient's rights under this agreement shall terminate if it    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this    agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. if all recipient's    rights under this agreement terminate, recipient agrees to cease use    and distribution of the program as soon as reasonably practicable.    however, recipient's obligations under this agreement and any licenses    granted by recipient relating to the program shall continue and survive.    everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this agreement,    but in order to avoid inconsistency the agreement is copyrighted and    may only be modified in the following manner. the agreement steward    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of    this agreement from time to time. no one other than the agreement    steward has the right to modify this agreement. the eclipse foundation    is the initial agreement steward. the eclipse foundation may assign the    responsibility to serve as the agreement steward to a suitable separate    entity. each new version of the agreement will be given a distinguishing    version number. the program (including contributions) may always be    distributed subject to the version of the agreement under which it was    received. in addition, after a new version of the agreement is published,    contributor may elect to distribute the program (including its    contributions) under the new version.    except as expressly stated in sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, recipient    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any    contributor under this agreement, whether expressly, by implication,    estoppel or otherwise. all rights in the program not expressly granted    under this agreement are reserved. nothing in this agreement is intended    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a contributor or recipient.    no third-party beneficiary rights are created under this agreement.    exhibit a - form of secondary licenses notice    "this source code may also be made available under the following     secondary licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth     in the eclipse public license, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."      simply including a copy of this agreement, including this exhibit a      is not sufficient to license the source code under secondary licenses.      if it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular      file, then you may include the notice in a location (such as a license      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to      look for such a notice.      you may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.---##    the gnu general public license (gpl) version 2, june 1991    copyright (c) 1989, 1991 free software foundation, inc.    51 franklin street, fifth floor    boston, ma 02110-1335    usa    everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.    preamble    the licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to    share and change it. by contrast, the gnu general public license is    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to    make sure the software is free for all its users. this general public    license applies to most of the free software foundation's software and    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (some other free    software foundation software is covered by the gnu library general    public license instead.) you can apply it to your programs, too.    when we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.    our general public licenses are designed to make sure that you have the    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.    to protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. these    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.    for example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.    you must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.    and you must show them these terms so they know their rights.    we protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,    distribute and/or modify the software.    also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free    software. if the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original    authors' reputations.    finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.    we wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program    proprietary. to prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.    the precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and    modification follow.    terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification    0. this license applies to any program or other work which contains a    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under    the terms of this general public license. the "program", below, refers    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the program" means    either the program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is    to say, a work containing the program or a portion of it, either    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.    (hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term    "modification".) each licensee is addressed as "you".    activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not    covered by this license; they are outside its scope. the act of running    the program is not restricted, and the output from the program is    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the program    (independent of having been made by running the program). whether that    is true depends on what the program does.    1. you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the program's source    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to    this license and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other    recipients of the program a copy of this license along with the program.    you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.    2. you may modify your copy or copies of the program or any portion of    it, thus forming a work based on the program, and copy and distribute    such modifications or work under the terms of section 1 above, provided    that you also meet all of these conditions:        a) you must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.        b) you must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in        whole or in part contains or is derived from the program or any part        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties        under the terms of this license.        c) if the modified program normally reads commands interactively        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this license.        (exception: if the program itself is interactive but does not        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the program        is not required to print an announcement.)    these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. if    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the program, and    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in    themselves, then this license, and its terms, do not apply to those    sections when you distribute them as separate works. but when you    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on    the program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this    license, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.    thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or    collective works based on the program.    in addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the program    with the program (or with a work based on the program) on a volume of a    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the    scope of this license.    3. you may copy and distribute the program (or a work based on it,    under section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of    sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:        a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of sections 1        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,        b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost        of physically performing source distribution, a complete        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be        distributed under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above on a medium        customarily used for software interchange; or,        c) accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to        distribute corresponding source code. (this alternative is allowed        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in        accord with subsection b above.)    the source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for    making modifications to it. for an executable work, complete source code    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control    compilation and installation of the executable. however, as a special    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the    executable.    if distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source    along with the object code.    4. you may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the program    except as expressly provided under this license. any attempt otherwise    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the program is void, and will    automatically terminate your rights under this license. however, parties    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this license will    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in    full compliance.    5. you are not required to accept this license, since you have not    signed it. however, nothing else grants you permission to modify or    distribute the program or its derivative works. these actions are    prohibited by law if you do not accept this license. therefore, by    modifying or distributing the program (or any work based on the    program), you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the    program or works based on it.    6. each time you redistribute the program (or any work based on the    program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the program subject to    these terms and conditions. you may not impose any further restrictions    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. you are not    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this license.    7. if, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this license, they do not    excuse you from the conditions of this license. if you cannot distribute    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not    distribute the program at all. for example, if a patent license would    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the program by all those who    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you    could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from    distribution of the program.    if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other    circumstances.    it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented    by public license practices. many people have made generous    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.    this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be    a consequence of the rest of this license.    8. if the distribution and/or use of the program is restricted in    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the    original copyright holder who places the program under this license may    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries    not thus excluded. in such case, this license incorporates the    limitation as if written in the body of this license.    9. the free software foundation may publish revised and/or new    versions of the general public license from time to time. such new    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.    each version is given a distinguishing version number. if the program    specifies a version number of this license which applies to it and "any    later version", you have the option of following the terms and    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by    the free software foundation. if the program does not specify a version    number of this license, you may choose any version ever published by the    free software foundation.    10. if you wish to incorporate parts of the program into other free    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the    author to ask for permission. for software which is copyrighted by the    free software foundation, write to the free software foundation; we    sometimes make exceptions for this. our decision will be guided by the    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.    no warranty    11. because the program is licensed free of charge, there is no    warranty for the program, to the extent permitted by applicable law.    except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and/or    other parties provide the program "as is" without warranty of any kind,    either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied    warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. the    entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with    you. should the program prove defective, you assume the cost of all    necessary servicing, repair or correction.    12. in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in    writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify    and/or redistribute the program as permitted above, be liable to you for    damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential    damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program    (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered    inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of    the program to operate with any other programs), even if such holder or    other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.    end of terms and conditions    how to apply these terms to your new programs    if you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.    to do so, attach the following notices to the program. it is safest to    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.        one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.        copyright (c) <year> <name of author>        this program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify        it under the terms of the gnu general public license as published by        the free software foundation; either version 2 of the license, or        (at your option) any later version.        this program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but        without any warranty; without even the implied warranty of        merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. see the gnu        general public license for more details.        you should have received a copy of the gnu general public license        along with this program; if not, write to the free software        foundation, inc., 51 franklin street, fifth floor, boston, ma 02110-1335 usa    also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.    if the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this    when it starts in an interactive mode:        gnomovision version 69, copyright (c) year name of author        gnomovision comes with absolutely no warranty; for details type        `show w'. this is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.    the hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the    appropriate parts of the general public license. of course, the commands    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.    you should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if    necessary. here is a sample; alter the names:        yoyodyne, inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the        program `gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by        james hacker.        signature of ty coon, 1 april 1989        ty coon, president of vice    this general public license does not permit incorporating your program    into proprietary programs. if your program is a subroutine library, you    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications    with the library. if this is what you want to do, use the gnu library    general public license instead of this license.---## classpath exception    linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is    making a combined work based on this library.  thus, the terms and    conditions of the gnu general public license version 2 cover the whole    combination.    as a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that    module.  an independent module is a module which is not derived from or    based on this library.  if you modify this library, you may extend this    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to    do so.  if you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement    from your version.

party modifications of contributor version, or (ii) the combination    of modifications made by that contributor with other software    (except as part of the contributor version) or other devices; or (3)    under patent claims infringed by covered software in the absence of    modifications made by that contributor.3. distribution obligations.    3.1. availability of source code.    any covered software that you distribute or otherwise make available    in executable form must also be made available in source code form    and that source code form must be distributed only under the terms    of this license. you must include a copy of this license with every    copy of the source code form of the covered software you distribute    or otherwise make available. you must inform recipients of any such    covered software in executable form as to how they can obtain such    covered software in source code form in a reasonable manner on or    through a medium customarily used for software exchange.    3.2. modifications.    the modifications that you create or to which you contribute are    governed by the terms of this license. you represent that you    believe your modifications are your original creation(s) and/or you    have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this license.    3.3. required notices.    you must include a notice in each of your modifications that    identifies you as the contributor of the modification. you may not    remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained    within the covered software, or any notices of licensing or any    descriptive text giving attribution to any contributor or the    initial developer.    3.4. application of additional terms.    you may not offer or impose any terms on any covered software in    source code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of    this license or the recipients' rights hereunder. you may choose to    offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or    liability obligations to one or more recipients of covered software.    however, you may do so only on your own behalf, and not on behalf of    the initial developer or any contributor. you must make it    absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or    liability obligation is offered by you alone, and you hereby agree    to indemnify the initial developer and every contributor for any    liability incurred by the initial developer or such contributor as a    result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms you offer.    3.5. distribution of executable versions.    you may distribute the executable form of the covered software under    the terms of this license or under the terms of a license of your    choice, which may contain terms different from this license,    provided that you are in compliance with the terms of this license    and that the license for the executable form does not attempt to    limit or alter the recipient's rights in the source code form from    the rights set forth in this license. if you distribute the covered    software in executable form under a different license, you must make    it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this license    are offered by you alone, not by the initial developer or    contributor. you hereby agree to indemnify the initial developer and    every contributor for any liability incurred by the initial    developer or such contributor as a result of any such terms you offer.    3.6. larger works.    you may create a larger work by combining covered software with    other code not governed by the terms of this license and distribute    the larger work as a single product. in such a case, you must make    sure the requirements of this license are fulfilled for the covered    software.4. versions of the license.    4.1. new versions.    oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or    new versions of this license from time to time. each version will be    given a distinguishing version number. except as provided in section    4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify    this license.    4.2. effect of new versions.    you may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the    covered software available under the terms of the version of the    license under which you originally received the covered software. if    the initial developer includes a notice in the original software    prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available    under any subsequent version of the license, you must distribute and    make the covered software available under the terms of the version    of the license under which you originally received the covered    software. otherwise, you may also choose to use, distribute or    otherwise make the covered software available under the terms of any    subsequent version of the license published by the license steward.    4.3. modified versions.    when you are an initial developer and you want to create a new    license for your original software, you may create and use a    modified version of this license if you: (a) rename the license and    remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to    note that the license differs from this license); and (b) otherwise    make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this    license.5. disclaimer of warranty.    covered software is provided under this license on an "as is" basis,    without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied,    including, without limitation, warranties that the covered software    is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or    non-infringing. the entire risk as to the quality and performance of    the covered software is with you. should any covered software prove    defective in any respect, you (not the initial developer or any    other contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,    repair or correction. this disclaimer of warranty constitutes an    essential part of this license. no use of any covered software is    authorized hereunder except under this disclaimer.6. termination.    6.1. this license and the rights granted hereunder will terminate    automatically if you fail to comply with terms herein and fail to    cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.    provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the    termination of this license shall survive.    6.2. if you assert a patent infringement claim (excluding    declaratory judgment actions) against initial developer or a    contributor (the initial developer or contributor against whom you    assert such claim is referred to as "participant") alleging that the    participant software (meaning the contributor version where the    participant is a contributor or the original software where the    participant is the initial developer) directly or indirectly    infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or    indirectly to you by such participant, the initial developer (if the    initial developer is not the participant) and all contributors under    sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this license shall, upon 60 days notice    from participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the    expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60    day period you withdraw your claim with respect to the participant    software against such participant either unilaterally or pursuant to    a written agreement with participant.    6.3. if you assert a patent infringement claim against participant    alleging that the participant software directly or indirectly    infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by    license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent    infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses    granted by such participant under sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken    into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or    license.    6.4. in the event of termination under sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,    all end user licenses that have been validly granted by you or any    distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses    granted to you by any distributor) shall survive termination.7. limitation of liability.    under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort    (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall you, the    initial developer, any other contributor, or any distributor of    covered software, or any supplier of any of such parties, be liable    to any person for any indirect, special, incidental, or    consequential damages of any character including, without    limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer    failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or    losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the    possibility of such damages. this limitation of liability shall not    apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such    party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such    limitation. some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or    limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion    and limitation may not apply to you.8. u.s. government end users.    the covered software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined    in 48 c.f.r. 2.101 (oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer    software" (as that term is defined at 48 c.f.r. §    252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation"    as such terms are used in 48 c.f.r. 12.212 (sept. 1995). consistent    with 48 c.f.r. 12.212 and 48 c.f.r. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4    (june 1995), all u.s. government end users acquire covered software    with only those rights set forth herein. this u.s. government rights    clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other far, dfar, or other    clause or provision that addresses government rights in computer    software under this license.9. miscellaneous.    this license represents the complete agreement concerning subject    matter hereof. if any provision of this license is held to be    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent    necessary to make it enforceable. this license shall be governed by    the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within    the original software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,    provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law    provisions. any litigation relating to this license shall be subject    to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and    venue specified in a notice contained within the original software,    with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without    limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.    the application of the united nations convention on contracts for    the international sale of goods is expressly excluded. any law or    regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be    construed against the drafter shall not apply to this license. you    agree that you alone are responsible for compliance with the united    states export administration regulations (and the export control    laws and regulation of any other countries) when you use, distribute    or otherwise make available any covered software.10. responsibility for claims.    as between initial developer and the contributors, each party is    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,    out of its utilization of rights under this license and you agree to    work with initial developer and contributors to distribute such    responsibility on an equitable basis. nothing herein is intended or    shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.------------------------------------------------------------------------notice pursuant to section 9 of the common development and distributionlicense (cddl)the code released under the cddl shall be governed by the laws of thestate of california (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). anylitigation relating to this license shall be subject to the jurisdictionof the federal courts of the northern district of california and thestate courts of the state of california, with venue lying in santa claracounty, california.  the gnu general public license (gpl) version 2, june 1991copyright (c) 1989, 1991 free software foundation, inc.51 franklin street, fifth floorboston, ma 02110-1335usaeveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copiesof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.preamblethe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom toshare and change it. by contrast, the gnu general public license isintended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--tomake sure the software is free for all its users. this general publiclicense applies to most of the free software foundation's software andto any other program whose authors commit to using it. (some other freesoftware foundation software is covered by the gnu library generalpublic license instead.) you can apply it to your programs, too.when we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.our general public licenses are designed to make sure that you have thefreedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for thisservice if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if youwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in newfree programs; and that you know you can do these things.to protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyoneto deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. theserestrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if youdistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.for example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratisor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.you must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.and you must show them these terms so they know their rights.we protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,distribute and/or modify the software.also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certainthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this freesoftware. if the software is modified by someone else and passed on, wewant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, sothat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the originalauthors' reputations.finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.we wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program willindividually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the programproprietary. to prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent mustbe licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.the precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution andmodification follow.terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification0. this license applies to any program or other work which contains anotice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed underthe terms of this general public license. the "program", below, refersto any such program or work, and a "work based on the program" meanseither the program or any derivative work under copyright law: that isto say, a work containing the program or a portion of it, eitherverbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.(hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term"modification".) each licensee is addressed as "you".activities other than copying, distribution and modification are notcovered by this license; they are outside its scope. the act of runningthe program is not restricted, and the output from the program iscovered only if its contents constitute a work based on the program(independent of having been made by running the program). whether thatis true depends on what the program does.1. you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the program's sourcecode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuouslyand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright noticeand disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer tothis license and to the absence of any warranty; and give any otherrecipients of the program a copy of this license along with the program.you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, andyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.2. you may modify your copy or copies of the program or any portion ofit, thus forming a work based on the program, and copy and distributesuch modifications or work under the terms of section 1 above, providedthat you also meet all of these conditions:    a) you must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.    b) you must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in    whole or in part contains or is derived from the program or any part    thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties    under the terms of this license.    c) if the modified program normally reads commands interactively    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this license.    (exception: if the program itself is interactive but does not    normally print such an announcement, your work based on the program    is not required to print an announcement.)these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. ifidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the program, andcan be reasonably considered independent and separate works inthemselves, then this license, and its terms, do not apply to thosesections when you distribute them as separate works. but when youdistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based onthe program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of thislicense, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entirewhole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contestyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is toexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative orcollective works based on the program.in addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the programwith the program (or with a work based on the program) on a volume of astorage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under thescope of this license.3. you may copy and distribute the program (or a work based on it,under section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms ofsections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of sections 1    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost    of physically performing source distribution, a complete    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be    distributed under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above on a medium    customarily used for software interchange; or,    c) accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to    distribute corresponding source code. (this alternative is allowed    only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the    program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in    accord with subsection b above.)the source code for a work means the preferred form of the work formaking modifications to it. for an executable work, complete source codemeans all the source code for all modules it contains, plus anyassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to controlcompilation and installation of the executable. however, as a specialexception, the source code distributed need not include anything that isnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the majorcomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system onwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies theexecutable.if distribution of executable or object code is made by offering accessto copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copythe source code from the same place counts as distribution of the sourcecode, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the sourcealong with the object code.4. you may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the programexcept as expressly provided under this license. any attempt otherwiseto copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the program is void, and willautomatically terminate your rights under this license. however, partieswho have received copies, or rights, from you under this license willnot have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain infull compliance.5. you are not required to accept this license, since you have notsigned it. however, nothing else grants you permission to modify ordistribute the program or its derivative works. these actions areprohibited by law if you do not accept this license. therefore, bymodifying or distributing the program (or any work based on theprogram), you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and allits terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying theprogram or works based on it.6. each time you redistribute the program (or any work based on theprogram), the recipient automatically receives a license from theoriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the program subject tothese terms and conditions. you may not impose any further restrictionson the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. you are notresponsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this license.7. if, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patentinfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement orotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this license, they do notexcuse you from the conditions of this license. if you cannot distributeso as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license andany other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may notdistribute the program at all. for example, if a patent license wouldnot permit royalty-free redistribution of the program by all those whoreceive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way youcould satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely fromdistribution of the program.if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable underany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended toapply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in othercircumstances.it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe anypatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of anysuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting theintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is implementedby public license practices. many people have made generouscontributions to the wide range of software distributed through thatsystem in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up tothe author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distributesoftware through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to bea consequence of the rest of this license.8. if the distribution and/or use of the program is restricted incertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, theoriginal copyright holder who places the program under this license mayadd an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding thosecountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countriesnot thus excluded. in such case, this license incorporates thelimitation as if written in the body of this license.9. the free software foundation may publish revised and/or newversions of the general public license from time to time. such newversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but maydiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.each version is given a distinguishing version number. if the programspecifies a version number of this license which applies to it and "anylater version", you have the option of following the terms andconditions either of that version or of any later version published bythe free software foundation. if the program does not specify a versionnumber of this license, you may choose any version ever published by thefree software foundation.10. if you wish to incorporate parts of the program into other freeprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to theauthor to ask for permission. for software which is copyrighted by thefree software foundation, write to the free software foundation; wesometimes make exceptions for this. our decision will be guided by thetwo goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our freesoftware and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.no warranty11. because the program is licensed free of charge, there is nowarranty for the program, to the extent permitted by applicable law.except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and/orother parties provide the program "as is" without warranty of any kind,either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the impliedwarranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. theentire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is withyou. should the program prove defective, you assume the cost of allnecessary servicing, repair or correction.12. in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to inwriting will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modifyand/or redistribute the program as permitted above, be liable to you fordamages, including any general, special, incidental or consequentialdamages arising out of the use or inability to use the program(including but not limited to loss of data or data being renderedinaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure ofthe program to operate with any other programs), even if such holder orother party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.end of terms and conditionshow to apply these terms to your new programsif you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatestpossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make itfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.to do so, attach the following notices to the program. it is safest toattach them to the start of each source file to most effectively conveythe exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.    copyright (c) <year> <name of author>    this program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify    it under the terms of the gnu general public license as published by    the free software foundation; either version 2 of the license, or    (at your option) any later version.    this program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but    without any warranty; without even the implied warranty of    merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. see the gnu    general public license for more details.    you should have received a copy of the gnu general public license    along with this program; if not, write to the free software    foundation, inc., 51 franklin street, fifth floor, boston, ma 02110-1335 usaalso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.if the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like thiswhen it starts in an interactive mode:    gnomovision version 69, copyright (c) year name of author    gnomovision comes with absolutely no warranty; for details type    `show w'. this is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute    it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.the hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show theappropriate parts of the general public license. of course, the commandsyou use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; theycould even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.you should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or yourschool, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, ifnecessary. here is a sample; alter the names:    yoyodyne, inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the    program `gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by    james hacker.    signature of ty coon, 1 april 1989    ty coon, president of vicethis general public license does not permit incorporating your programinto proprietary programs. if your program is a subroutine library, youmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applicationswith the library. if this is what you want to do, use the gnu librarygeneral public license instead of this license.#certain source files distributed by oracle america, inc. and/or itsaffiliates are subject to the following clarification and specialexception to the gplv2, based on the gnu project exception for itsclasspath libraries, known as the gnu classpath exception, but onlywhere oracle has expressly included in the particular source file'sheader the words "oracle designates this particular file as subject tothe "classpath" exception as provided by oracle in the license filethat accompanied this code."you should also note that oracle includes multiple, independentprograms in this software package. some of those programs are providedunder licenses deemed incompatible with the gplv2 by the free softwarefoundation and others.  for example, the package includes programslicensed under the apache license, version 2.0.  such programs arelicensed to you under their original licenses.oracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by addingthe classpath exception to the necessary parts of its gplv2 code, whichpermits you to use that code in combination with other independentmodules not licensed under the gplv2.  however, note that this wouldnot permit you to commingle code under an incompatible license withoracle's gplv2 licensed code by, for example, cutting and pasting suchcode into a file also containing oracle's gplv2 licensed code and thendistributing the result.  additionally, if you were to remove theclasspath exception from any of the files to which it applies anddistribute the result, you would likely be required to license some orall of the other code in that distribution under the gplv2 as well, andsince the gplv2 is incompatible with the license terms of some itemsincluded in the distribution by oracle, removing the classpathexception could therefore effectively compromise your ability tofurther distribute the package.proceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of alawyer skilled in open source matters before removing the classpathexception or making modifications to this package which maysubsequently be redistributed and/or involve the use of third partysoftware.classpath exceptionlinking this library statically or dynamically with other modules ismaking a combined work based on this library.  thus, the terms andconditions of the gnu general public license version 2 cover the wholecombination.as a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give youpermission to link this library with independent modules to produce anexecutable, regardless of the license terms of these independentmodules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable underterms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linkedindependent module, the terms and conditions of the license of thatmodule.  an independent module is a module which is not derived from orbased on this library.  if you modify this library, you may extend thisexception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated todo so.  if you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statementfrom your version.

DISCARDED: eclipse public license - v 2.0    the accompanying program is provided under the terms of this eclipse    public license ("agreement"). any use, reproduction or distribution    of the program constitutes recipient's acceptance of this agreement.1. definitions"contribution" means:  a) in the case of the initial contributor, the initial content     distributed under this agreement, and  b) in the case of each subsequent contributor:     i) changes to the program, and     ii) additions to the program;  where such changes and/or additions to the program originate from  and are distributed by that particular contributor. a contribution  "originates" from a contributor if it was added to the program by  such contributor itself or anyone acting on such contributor's behalf.  contributions do not include changes or additions to the program that  are not modified works."contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the program."licensed patents" mean patent claims licensable by a contributor whichare necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its contribution aloneor when combined with the program."program" means the contributions distributed in accordance with thisagreement."recipient" means anyone who receives the program under this agreementor any secondary license (as applicable), including contributors."derivative works" shall mean any work, whether in source code or otherform, that is based on (or derived from) the program and for which theeditorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modificationsrepresent, as a whole, an original work of authorship."modified works" shall mean any work in source code or other form thatresults from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of thecontents of the program, including, for purposes of clarity any new filein source code form that contains any contents of the program. modifiedworks shall not include works that contain only declarations,interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the program solelyin each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the programor modified works thereof."distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making availablein any manner that enables the transfer of a copy."source code" means the form of a program preferred for makingmodifications, including but not limited to software source code,documentation source, and configuration files."secondary license" means either the gnu general public license,version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including anyexceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initialcontributor.2. grant of rights  a) subject to the terms of this agreement, each contributor hereby  grants recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright  license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,  publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the contribution of such  contributor, if any, and such derivative works.  b) subject to the terms of this agreement, each contributor hereby  grants recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent  license under licensed patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,  import and otherwise transfer the contribution of such contributor,  if any, in source code or other form. this patent license shall  apply to the combination of the contribution and the program if, at  the time the contribution is added by the contributor, such addition  of the contribution causes such combination to be covered by the  licensed patents. the patent license shall not apply to any other  combinations which include the contribution. no hardware per se is  licensed hereunder.  c) recipient understands that although each contributor grants the  licenses to its contributions set forth herein, no assurances are  provided by any contributor that the program does not infringe the  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.  each contributor disclaims any liability to recipient for claims  brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual  property rights or otherwise. as a condition to exercising the  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each recipient hereby  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual  property rights needed, if any. for example, if a third party  patent license is required to allow recipient to distribute the  program, it is recipient's responsibility to acquire that license  before distributing the program.  d) each contributor represents that to its knowledge it has  sufficient copyright rights in its contribution, if any, to grant  the copyright license set forth in this agreement.  e) notwithstanding the terms of any secondary license, no  contributor makes additional grants to any recipient (other than  those set forth in this agreement) as a result of such recipient's  receipt of the program under the terms of a secondary license  (if permitted under the terms of section 3).3. requirements3.1 if a contributor distributes the program in any form, then:  a) the program must also be made available as source code, in  accordance with section 3.2, and the contributor must accompany  the program with a statement that the source code for the program  is available under this agreement, and informs recipients how to  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily  used for software exchange; and  b) the contributor may distribute the program under a license  different than this agreement, provided that such license:     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other contributors all     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness     for a particular purpose;     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other contributors all     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights     in the source code under section 3.2; and     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the program by any     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements     of this section 3.3.2 when the program is distributed as source code:  a) it must be made available under this agreement, or if the  program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or  files made available under a secondary license, and (ii) the initial  contributor attached to the source code the notice described in  exhibit a of this agreement, then the program may be made available  under the terms of such secondary licenses, and  b) a copy of this agreement must be included with each copy of  the program.3.3 contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitationsof liability ("notices") contained within the program from any copy ofthe program which they distribute, provided that contributors may addtheir own appropriate notices.4. commercial distributioncommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilitieswith respect to end users, business partners and the like. while thislicense is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the program,the contributor who includes the program in a commercial productoffering should do so in a manner which does not create potentialliability for other contributors. therefore, if a contributor includesthe program in a commercial product offering, such contributor("commercial contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify everyother contributor ("indemnified contributor") against any losses,damages and costs (collectively "losses") arising from claims, lawsuitsand other legal actions brought by a third party against the indemnifiedcontributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of suchcommercial contributor in connection with its distribution of the programin a commercial product offering. the obligations in this section do notapply to any claims or losses relating to any actual or allegedintellectual property infringement. in order to qualify, an indemnifiedcontributor must: a) promptly notify the commercial contributor inwriting of such claim, and b) allow the commercial contributor to control,and cooperate with the commercial contributor in, the defense and anyrelated settlement negotiations. the indemnified contributor mayparticipate in any such claim at its own expense.for example, a contributor might include the program in a commercialproduct offering, product x. that contributor is then a commercialcontributor. if that commercial contributor then makes performanceclaims, or offers warranties related to product x, those performanceclaims and warranties are such commercial contributor's responsibilityalone. under this section, the commercial contributor would have todefend claims against the other contributors related to those performanceclaims and warranties, and if a court requires any other contributor topay any damages as a result, the commercial contributor must paythose damages.5. no warrantyexcept as expressly set forth in this agreement, and to the extentpermitted by applicable law, the program is provided on an "as is"basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express orimplied including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions oftitle, non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particularpurpose. each recipient is solely responsible for determining theappropriateness of using and distributing the program and assumes allrisks associated with its exercise of rights under this agreement,including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programsor equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.6. disclaimer of liabilityexcept as expressly set forth in this agreement, and to the extentpermitted by applicable law, neither recipient nor any contributorsshall have any liability for any direct, indirect, incidental, special,exemplary, or consequential damages (including without limitation lostprofits), however caused and on any theory of liability, whether incontract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise)arising in any way out of the use or distribution of the program or theexercise of any rights granted hereunder, even if advised of thepossibility of such damages.7. generalif any provision of this agreement is invalid or unenforceable underapplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability ofthe remainder of the terms of this agreement, and without furtheraction by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to theminimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.if recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that theprogram itself (excluding combinations of the program with other softwareor hardware) infringes such recipient's patent(s), then such recipient'srights granted under section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date suchlitigation is filed.all recipient's rights under this agreement shall terminate if itfails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of thisagreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period oftime after becoming aware of such noncompliance. if all recipient'srights under this agreement terminate, recipient agrees to cease useand distribution of the program as soon as reasonably practicable.however, recipient's obligations under this agreement and any licensesgranted by recipient relating to the program shall continue and survive.everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this agreement,but in order to avoid inconsistency the agreement is copyrighted andmay only be modified in the following manner. the agreement stewardreserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) ofthis agreement from time to time. no one other than the agreementsteward has the right to modify this agreement. the eclipse foundationis the initial agreement steward. the eclipse foundation may assign theresponsibility to serve as the agreement steward to a suitable separateentity. each new version of the agreement will be given a distinguishingversion number. the program (including contributions) may always bedistributed subject to the version of the agreement under which it wasreceived. in addition, after a new version of the agreement is published,contributor may elect to distribute the program (including itscontributions) under the new version.except as expressly stated in sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, recipientreceives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of anycontributor under this agreement, whether expressly, by implication,estoppel or otherwise. all rights in the program not expressly grantedunder this agreement are reserved. nothing in this agreement is intendedto be enforceable by any entity that is not a contributor or recipient.no third-party beneficiary rights are created under this agreement.exhibit a - form of secondary licenses notice"this source code may also be made available under the following secondary licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the eclipse public license, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."  simply including a copy of this agreement, including this exhibit a  is not sufficient to license the source code under secondary licenses.  if it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular  file, then you may include the notice in a location (such as a license  file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to  look for such a notice.  you may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.eclipse distribution license - v 1.0copyright (c) 2007, eclipse foundation, inc. and its licensors.all rights
